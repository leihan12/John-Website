    "bio":"I am presently studying Management Information Systems at Boston University with an expected graduation date of May 2022. My major coursework has also cultivated an interest in Computer Science, which I am currently pursuing a minor in as well. I am particularly interested in how information technology is increasingly more vital in the creation of social good and opportunities for all individuals. I enjoy challenging myself by taking on a rigorous academic courseload each semester. My main interests outside of work include exploring the world where I can learn all about cultures outside of my comfort zone.",
